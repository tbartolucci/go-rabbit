# Go Queue Project

Simple Go AMQP Producer and Consumer that generates two random numbers and 
prints out the sum.

Docker compose file provided to run a local RabbitMQ. View the status in the 
admin dashboard at [http://localhost:15672](http://localhost:15672)

Structurally probably not the best implementation but reduced duplicate code for this example.
